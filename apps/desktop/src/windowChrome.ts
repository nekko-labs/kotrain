/**
 * The window-chrome contract, shared by main and preload.

 * Kotrain draws its own title bar: one strip carrying the wordmark, with the
 * OS buttons sitting in the same line and the same colour as the app behind
 * them. That needs two things crossing the process boundary — the platform, so
 * the renderer knows which side to leave clear, and the theme colours, so the
 * native buttons repaint when the app goes light or dark.
 *
 * Deliberately not part of `IpcChannels`: everything there is routed through
 * the shared Host dispatcher and reimplemented by the web transport, and a
 * browser tab has no window chrome to speak of.

 * The renderer's half of the window chrome.

 * Kotrain draws its own title bar so the OS buttons sit on the same line, in
 * the same colour, as the app behind them. Only the desktop shell has one:
 * `window.kotrainChrome` is exposed by the Electron preload and is simply
 * absent in a browser tab or a Capacitor build, which is how everything here
 * knows to do nothing.
 *
 * The bridge's own shape lives in `src/windowChrome.ts`, shared with main and
 * preload; the renderer builds from a different Vite root and only needs the
 * two members it actually calls, so it reads them off the global instead of
 * importing across the root boundary.
